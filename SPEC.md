# Admin Dashboard Specification

## Overview

A modern admin dashboard built with:
- Edge-first architecture using Cloudflare Workers
- Neon Serverless Postgres for database
- Clerk for authentication
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Hono for API routing
- React + Vite for frontend

## Current Status

### Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Neon + Drizzle integration
- [x] Basic user model implementation
- [x] Clerk webhook integration
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Type-safe schema validation with Zod
- [x] User metadata storage
- [x] Transaction-free database operations for Neon HTTP
- [x] Structured logging implementation
- [x] Webhook payload validation
- [x] User lifecycle event handling (create/update/delete)

### In Progress
- [ ] Frontend implementation
- [ ] User management UI
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] E2E testing setup

## Architecture

### Backend (Cloudflare Worker)

#### API Routes
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/webhooks/clerk` - Clerk webhook endpoint for user sync

#### Database Schema
Currently implemented tables:
- `users` - Stores user information synced from Clerk
  - Basic fields: id, clerkId, email, firstName, lastName
  - Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt
- `user_data` - Stores user metadata
  - Flexible key-value storage
  - Used for signup tracking and name history

#### Authentication & User Management
- Clerk handles user authentication
- Webhook integration for user sync:
  - User creation with metadata
  - User updates with change tracking
  - User deletion with cleanup
- All database operations are transaction-free for Neon HTTP compatibility

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- To be implemented
- Will use React Query for data fetching
- Material UI for components
- Type-safe API client

## Development Setup

1. Environment Variables:
```bash
# Neon Database
NEON_DATABASE_URL=

# Clerk
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Cloudflare
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
```

2. Development Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement user search and filtering
2. Add user profile management
3. Set up frontend project structure
4. Implement role-based access control
5. Add API documentation
6. Set up testing infrastructure
