# Project Vision

## Mission Statement

Provide a modern, secure, and scalable full-stack starter template for building multi-tenant applications on Cloudflare. For a technical overview of how this vision is implemented, see the [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Core Principles

1. Edge-First Architecture
   - Leverage edge computing for optimal global performance
   - Efficient data persistence at the edge
   - Implement real-time updates through edge computing

2. Flexible Tenancy Models
   - Internal: Single user table for internal business tools
     - Direct user management without organization complexity
     - Simplified authentication and access control
     - Optimized for internal business workflows

   - Single Tenant: Isolated data per user
     - Complete data isolation between users
     - Individual user-specific customization
     - Simplified deployment and maintenance

   - Multi Tenant: Full organization support
     - Team and organization management
     - Cross-organization security boundaries
     - Resource sharing and isolation controls

3. Developer Experience
   - Type-safe end-to-end development
   - Rich React component ecosystem utilization
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - Streamlined local development experience

4. Local-First Architecture
   - Offline-capable data persistence and operations
   - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for sync
   - Seamless background synchronization
   - Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
   - Efficient handling and display of large datasets
   - Smooth scrolling and rendering of extensive business data

5. Plugin Architecture
   - Modular core system with clear extension points
   - Type-safe plugin interfaces for frontend and backend
   - Versioned plugin API with backward compatibility

6. Superuser Operations
   - Real-time system health monitoring dashboard
   - Model-specific administration tools
   - System-wide configuration and feature flags
   - Audit logs and operation tracing

7. Production Ready
   - Model-appropriate authentication strategies
   - Secure payment processing where needed
   - Robust error handling and monitoring
   - Production-grade security practices

8. AI-Ready Documentation
   - Structured documentation optimized for AI consumption
   - Semantic linking between code and documentation
   - Clear context boundaries and relationship mapping
   - Living documentation that evolves with the codebase
   - AI-assisted troubleshooting paths

9. Developer Productivity Suite
   - Built-in development metrics and analytics
   - Automated code quality benchmarking
   - Integrated CI/CD workflow templates
   - Advanced debugging and profiling tools
   - Performance optimization insights

10. External API and Webhook Integration
    - Structure for adding external API handlers
    - Structure for adding webhook handlers
