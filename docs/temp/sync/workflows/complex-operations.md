# Complex Operations & Cloudflare Workflows

## Overview
For certain complex operations, we use Cloudflare Workflows to handle long-running tasks and complex orchestration. These workflows provide built-in durability, state management, and sophisticated retry mechanisms.

## Use Cases

### 1. Bulk Operations
- Large organization deletions with many members
- Bulk user imports or migrations
- Mass data cleanup tasks
- Cross-organization data transfers

### 2. Long-Running Tasks
- Complex consistency checks
- Data reconciliation jobs
- Resource-intensive cleanup operations
- Multi-stage data transformations

## Workflow Architecture

### State Management
- Persistent state across steps
- Checkpoint management
- Progress tracking
- Recovery mechanisms

### Error Handling
- Retry policies
- Failure recovery
- Error reporting
- Alert mechanisms

### Monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Alert thresholds

## Implementation Patterns

### Task Queuing
- Queue management
- Priority handling
- Rate limiting
- Backoff strategies

### State Persistence
- Checkpoint storage
- State recovery
- Data consistency
- Rollback mechanisms

### Event Emission
- Progress notifications
- Status updates
- Error reporting
- Completion events

### Progress Reporting
- Status tracking
- Completion estimation
- User notifications
- Admin dashboards

## Common Workflows

### Bulk User Operations
- Mass imports
- Bulk updates
- Permission changes
- Data migrations

### Organization Migrations
- Data transfer
- Member migration
- Settings transfer
- Resource relocation

### Data Reconciliation
- Consistency checks
- Data repair
- Orphan cleanup
- Index rebuilding

### Resource Cleanup
- Stale data removal
- Cache rebuilding
- Index optimization
- Storage reclamation

## Benefits
- Built-in durability and retry mechanisms
- State persistence across steps
- Can run for extended periods (minutes to days)
- Better handling of complex failure scenarios

## Implementation Notes
Keep the current direct sync implementation for standard CRUD operations, and selectively use Workflows only for operations that:
- Require multiple stages of execution
- Need sophisticated retry logic
- Could take longer than Worker time limits
- Require persistent state tracking

## Development
- Local testing
- Debugging strategies
- Deployment process
- Best practices
