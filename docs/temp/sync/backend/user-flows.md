# User Sync Flows

## User Created Event

### 1. Webhook Received
- Clerk sends webhook to our API endpoint
- Webhook handler validates the Clerk signature
- Event is parsed and validated against our schema
- If validation fails, returns 400/401 to Clerk
- If valid, event is passed to user sync service

### 2. Initial Validation
- Sync service checks for required fields:
  * Must have a Clerk ID
  * Must have at least one email address
  * Must have either first or last name
- Makes API call to Clerk to verify user exists
- If any validation fails, process stops here

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Checks our database for existing user with same Clerk ID
- If found, marks sync as success (idempotency)
- Checks for any users with same email address
- If email conflict found, alerts admin and stops

### 4. Data Processing
- Finds primary email (prefers verified email)
- Formats user's name for display
- Prepares metadata and timestamps
- Sets up default role and status
- Generates any required IDs or references

### 5. Database Operations
- Starts a database transaction
- Creates main user record
- Creates user settings with defaults
- Stores Clerk metadata
- If any step fails, rolls back entire transaction

### 6. Cache & Search Updates
- Clears any existing user caches
- Updates search indexes with new user
- Updates any relevant member lists
- Updates organization caches if needed

### 7. Frontend Notifications
- Sends websocket event to connected clients
- Updates user lists in UI
- Updates member lists in organizations
- Updates navigation if needed
- Shows success/error notifications

### 8. Monitoring & Cleanup
- Records sync duration and success
- Logs completion with relevant details
- Updates sync status in database
- Triggers any necessary alerts
- Cleans up temporary data

## User Updated Event

### 1. Change Detection
- Loads existing user from database
- Compares incoming data with stored data
- Identifies which fields have changed
- If nothing changed, ends process successfully

### 2. Update Validation
- Validates any changed email addresses
- Checks for email conflicts
- Verifies role changes are allowed
- Validates new field values

### 3. Database Updates
- Starts transaction
- Updates only changed fields
- Updates last modified timestamp
- Updates email verification status if changed
- Updates profile data if changed

### 4. Related Data Updates
- Updates user settings if needed
- Updates organization memberships if needed
- Updates search indexes
- Updates caches

### 5. Frontend Updates
- Notifies connected clients
- Updates UI components
- Shows update notifications
- Refreshes relevant views

### 6. Cleanup & Monitoring
- Logs changes made
- Records sync metrics
- Sends alerts if needed
- Updates sync status

## User Deleted Event

### 1. Pre-deletion Checks
- Verifies user exists in our system
- Checks user's organization memberships
- Identifies owned organizations
- Checks for blocking conditions

### 2. Organization Cleanup
- Removes user from all organizations
- Transfers ownership if needed
- Updates organization member counts
- Updates organization caches

### 3. Data Cleanup
- Removes user settings
- Removes user metadata
- Removes search index entries
- Removes cache entries

### 4. User Deletion

- Updates related records
- Maintains audit trail
- Handles soft vs hard delete

### 5. Frontend Cleanup
- Notifies connected clients
- Removes user from lists
- Updates organization views
- Shows deletion notifications

### 6. Monitoring & Verification
- Verifies complete removal
- Logs deletion details
- Records metrics
- Sends admin notifications
