## Documentation Types

### Core Documentation
- **[Vision Document](VISION.md)**: Project goals, principles, and motivations
- **[Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md)**: System design and components

### Technical Notebooks
Living documentation of implemented systems in [notebooks/](notebooks/):
- `core/`: Foundation systems (auth, data, etc.)
- `features/`: User-facing feature implementations
- `patterns/`: Reusable patterns and best practices
- `infrastructure/`: Deployment and operations

Each notebook includes:
- Technical deep-dive of implementation
- Key decisions and rationale
- Current limitations and improvements
- Usage examples and patterns
- Performance characteristics
- Testing approaches

### Release Documentation
Version-specific documentation in [releases/](releases/):

#### Version Plans
- Goals and timeline
- Success criteria
- Major milestones

#### Stories
User and business requirements with:
- Unique IDs (e.g., STORY-3.1)
- Non-technical language
- Clear success criteria
- Related story references

#### Implementation Details
Point release specifications with:
- Technical implementation details
- Code examples and patterns
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria

## Story to Implementation Flow

Example flow for single-tenant foundation:

1. Story (in `STORIES.md`):
   ```md
   ## STORY-3.1: Code Cleanup
   As a developer, I need to remove all organization and multi-tenant code.

   Success:
   - Organization components removed
   - Multi-tenant code removed
   - Clean codebase structure
   - No tenant-related types

   Related: STORY-3.2 (User Authentication)
   ```

2. Implementation (in `v0.2-tenancy/v0.2.1-code-organization.md`):
   ```md
   # v0.2.1 - Code Organization

   ## Overview
   This specification outlines the process of removing organization/multi-tenant 
   code and establishing a clean single-tenant foundation.

   ## Implementation
   1. Remove organization components
   2. Clean up routing structure
   3. Remove tenant context
   ...
   ```

3. Release Overview (in `v0.2-tenancy/OVERVIEW.md`):
   ```md
   # v0.2 Single Tenant Foundation

   ## Goals
   - Remove all organization and multi-tenant code
   - Implement clean authentication with Clerk
   - Set up basic sync service for user data
   - Establish minimal UI for verification

   ## Implementation Plan
   ### Phase 1: Code Cleanup
   - Remove organization components and types
   - Clean up routing structure
   ...
   ```

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Vision Document](VISION.md) to understand project goals
2. Review the [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
3. Explore [Technical Notebooks](notebooks/) for implementation details
4. Follow current development in [Version 0 Plan](releases/v0/VERSION_PLAN.md)
