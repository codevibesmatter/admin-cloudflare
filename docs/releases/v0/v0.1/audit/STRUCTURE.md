# Audit Documentation Structure

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive findings from the v0.1 audit phase. The documentation is organized to be:
- Easy to navigate
- Maintainable over time
- Actionable for implementation
- Useful for different stakeholders

## Existing Documentation

The `/notebooks` directory contains detailed implementation documentation that should be reviewed as part of the audit:
- AUTH.md - Authentication implementation details
- DATABASE.md - Database architecture and patterns
- TYPE-SAFETY.md - Type system implementation
- WEBHOOK_WORKER.md - Webhook processing details
- SYNC_SERVICES.md - Data synchronization architecture
- ORGANIZATIONS.md - Organization management
- ADDING_ROUTES.md - API route implementation
- protected-paths.md - Security-sensitive paths
- adding-api-endpoints.md - API development guidelines

These files provide valuable context about current implementation and should inform the audit findings.

## Document Structure

Each audit document follows this structure:

### 1. Current State
- Factual description of implementation
- Key components and relationships
- Current patterns and practices
- Existing documentation

### 2. Findings
- Issues identified
- Anti-patterns discovered
- Performance concerns
- Security considerations
- Maintenance challenges

### 3. Analysis
- Root causes
- Impact assessment
- Risk evaluation
- Dependencies affected
- Performance implications

### 4. Recommendations
- Specific action items
- Priority levels
- Effort estimates
- Implementation approach
- Required changes

## Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Include mermaid diagrams for visualization
- Link to specific code when relevant
- Keep sections focused and concise
- Update as new findings emerge

### For Reviewers
- Each document should be self-contained
- Cross-reference related findings
- Include context for recommendations
- Provide clear next steps
- Consider different audiences

## Cross-Referencing

Since we're using a flat structure, use these conventions for cross-referencing:
- Link to other documents using relative paths: `[Web App Findings](./WEB.md)`
- Reference specific sections with anchors: `[Security Concerns](./SECURITY.md#concerns)`
- Use consistent heading structure for reliable anchors
- Keep file names in UPPERCASE for clarity

## Maintenance

The audit documentation should be:
1. Updated as findings are validated
2. Linked to implementation PRs
3. Marked when issues are resolved
4. Versioned with major changes

## Next Steps

1. Review this structure with team
2. Begin populating each document
3. Link findings to v0.2 tasks
4. Track implementation progress
